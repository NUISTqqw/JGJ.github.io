Hi! I'm Guanjie Jiao from the [School of Atmospheric Sciences](https://as.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) (NJU). 

My major is Atmospheric Science (Atmospheric Environment and Atmospheric Chemistry), focusing on the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) system. My research interest is the development of numerical models (i.e., WRF-Chem, and GEOS-Chem) using in-situ observations, satellite remote sensing, and artificial intelligence (AI). I also have a great passion for the feedback impact of the atmosphere, e.g., phenology, public health, crop production, and climate resources.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sijia Lou](https://as.nju.edu.cn/c4/16/c11341a443414/page.htm) from [Atmospheric Environment and Atmospheric Physics](https://as.nju.edu.cn/32/9a/c11320a602778/page.htm) (ACP) Lab. I was advised by [Prof. Lei Chen](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/ichenlei/zh_CN/), [Prof. Jia Zhu](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/zhujia/zh_CN/index.htm), and [Prof. Xiaochen Zhu](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/zhuxiaochen/zh_CN/index.htm) from [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/?v=1.0.24) (NUIST), and [Prof. Rangjian Qiu](https://swrh.whu.edu.cn/info/1081/91971.htm) from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) (WHU).
